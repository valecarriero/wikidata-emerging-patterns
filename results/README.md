The folder `all_subgraphs` contains all the subgraphs, one for each pattern, by selecting from the whole domain subgraph only the triples with an instance of the given class - or one of its subclasses - as subject.  E.g., for the class _album_, we will build a subgraph containing all the triples about instances of album or subclasses of album.
