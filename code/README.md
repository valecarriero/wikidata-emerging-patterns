# Code for extracting Emerging Patterns from Wikidata

For extracting Emerging Patterns (EPs) from (a portion of) Wikidata, you first need to install KGTK and import a (sub)dump of Wikidata using it.
Indeed, our code relies on KGTK.

Useful links:
- [KGTK documentation](https://kgtk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [KGTK GitHub repository](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/kgtk)
- [notebook for importing Wikidata](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/kgtk-notebooks/blob/main/use-cases/create_wikidata/Wikidata-Useful-Files.ipynb)

Then, you need to run the `wikidata_patterns.sh` bash script from the command line.
You will be asked to give as input:
- the path of the folder where to store all results
- the edgefile of your Wikidata (sub)graph generated by KGTK
- the labelfile/nodefile of your Wikidata (sub)graph generated by KGTK
- the edgefile containing the P279star triples from the whole Wikidata dump (see the [notebook for importing Wikidata](https://github.com/usc-isi-i2/kgtk-notebooks/blob/main/use-cases/create_wikidata/Wikidata-Useful-Files.ipynb) for instructions)
- the edgefile containing the P31 triples from the whole Wikidata dump (we also need the types of the objects of the triples in your subgraph)
- the 3 thresholds to be used for selecting the most common classes, the most common properties per each class, the most common ranges per each property

Refer to the `results/README.md` file to know which files will be generated as a result.
